Wildfire Prediction in the US 


* Introduction
Wildfires in the US have had a major impact, not only on the air quality, but also on global climate change because burning plants and trees releases planet-warming CO2. The wildfire season is starting early and ending late each year. Through this project, we hope to build a predictive model that leverages the data collected from all over the country consisting of about 1.88 Million instances of wildfires.

* Abstract
In this project, we aim to develop a tool that uses this data and predicts the impact of wildfires in terms of damage done in size based on a variety of factors like state, county, exact geographical location, etc. This insight can then be used by a number of people to make informed decisions on prevention and control of wildfires.

* Approach
We would be doing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to identify key characteristics and relationships that would help us develop a good machine learning model. We would also do data preprocessing tasks to ensure data quality. We would then train various models starting with a baseline model like Logistic Regression and then move on to more sophisticated ones like ensemble models and deep neural networks. The model that performs best would be chosen for making predictions.

* Persona
The fire department or a similar agency responsible for mitigating the fires can use this model to further aid their prevention and mitigation efforts.
Travel and campers enthusiasts can use this to identify potential wildfire zones before planning their roadtrips.
